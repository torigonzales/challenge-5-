Challenge #5- Daily Planner 

## Introduction 
This week we were challenged to create a Daily planner! I am a little late to turning in this challenge! I have been out of town!

---

## Challenges

Luckily we were given some starter code this week to start off the challnege! That made this application a little easier to build!

## Victories
I really enjoyed designing the page and using "Coolors" as a resource for color pallets!

The app started to come along really nicely as I began to add style to it!

The design aspect is proabably my favorite part of the process. I found another really cool resource for adding icons! I decided to utilize that also!
